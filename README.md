# Information-Theory-and-Coding-Project

Bit Error Rate Performance comparison was done for three different linear block codes - (3,1) Repetition Code, (5,1) Repetition Code, (7,4) Hamming Code.

The channel coding was performed on a BPSK modulated digital signal. 

Comparison was also made between Hard-Decision Decoding and Soft-Decision-Decoding for each of the linear block codes.
